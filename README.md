# designr

Rules library for modern, accessible, performant web apps—intended as drop-in guidance for how your AI coding tools should build UI (defaults, interaction, accessibility, performance, production polish).

## What this repo contains

- **`designr.md`**: the single source of truth for the rules.
- **`index.html`**: a small docs UI that embeds `designr.md`, renders it into sections, and adds search + copy.

## Usage

- **Install (as a command)**:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cedlll.github.io/designr/install.sh | bash
```

- **Apply in your AI coding tool**: type `/designr`
